# PSO algorithm

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the social behavior of birds and fish. It involves a population of particles that move around a search space, adjusting their positions based on their own best known solution and the best solution found by the swarm.

### Example

Finding global maximum of the function
</br>
</br>
```math
f(x,y) = e{^{-(x-10)^2 -(y-10)^2+1}}
```

</p>
</br>
Global maximum is in (10, 10)
